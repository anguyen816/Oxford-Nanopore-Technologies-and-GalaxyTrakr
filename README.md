# Oxford-Nanopore-Technologies-and-GalaxyTrakr

The objective of this project is to perform ONT (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) data analysis for bacterial genome assembly and its initial characterization using GalaxyTrakr. The project aims to leverage the high-throughput sequencing capabilities of ONT to generate accurate and comprehensive bacterial genome assemblies. Using GalaxyTrakr, the project will involve uploading sequencing data, filtering for read quality and sizes, and assembling the bacterial genome from the high-quality data. Following the assembly, quality control (QC) will be conducted to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the genome. The bacterial species will be identified, and further analysis will include Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) to determine the genetic profile, as well as the identification of antimicrobial resistance genes, including stress and virulence genes, for relevant bacterial strains. Serotyping for Salmonella and E. coli will also be performed to identify their serological profiles. Additionally, optional annotation of the bacterial genome will be conducted to identify functional genomic elements. This workflow aims to provide detailed insights into bacterial genomics, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence factors.
